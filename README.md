# handlebars-helpers-examples

> This project shows the amazing things you can accomplish with [Assemble](http://assemble.io) and the helpers from the [handlebars-helpers][helpers] library.

## Getting Started

* **[Download this project][download]** and unzip it into a new folder.
* In the project folder, run `npm install` to install [Assemble][assemble], [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and any other dependencies.
* Once the dependencies are installed you may run `grunt assemble` to build the example project.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile][gruntfile], as well as install and use Grunt plugins.


## The helpers

The helpers in the `./experimental` are exactly that, experimental. If you use helpers in that directory on your projects, don't be surprised if something breaks (but please let us know so we can fix it!).


[handlebars-helpers][helpers] is the maintained by the core team of [Assemble][assemble], a component, site and documentation generator based on Grunt.js. The helpers in this project can be used with our without Assemble.

If you want to see the types of helpers that are included, either visit the [handlebars-helpers][helpers] repo or just pull down this project, install the dependencies (`npm install`), and run `grunt build`.

Then go to the `./src` and `./dest` directories to look around.

## Contributing

We want to continue building this library, so if you have helpers you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request on the [handlebars-helpers][helpers] project.
